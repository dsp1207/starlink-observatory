# starlink-observatory
This script checks whether conditions are favorable to see a train of Starlink satellites from the third launch from a given location on the current day, and notifies you through IFTTT

Here's an example of what a sighting can look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytUygPqjXEc

Note: Starlink satellites spread out over time after the launch, so the best time to see them is shortly after launch. You can simply update HEAVENS_ABOVE_URL with the link for future launches. 

I run this as a daily task on pythonanywhere
